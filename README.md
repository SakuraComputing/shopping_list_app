# AO Shopping List demo app

A small demonstration application written in React using Local Storage to presist the data.  Basic CSS has been applied to showcase AO styling.  Basic CSS Grid was used (so non responsive) as per this version.

git clone github.com/SakuraComputing/shopping_list_app

yarn run start 
```
